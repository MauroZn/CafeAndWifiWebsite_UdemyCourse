## Assignment
On day 66, we create an API that serves data on cafes with wifi and good coffee. Today, you're going to use the data from that project to build a fully-fledged website to display the information.<br>
Included in this assignment is an SQLite database called cafes.db that lists all the cafe data.<br>
Using this database and what you learnt about REST APIs and web development, create a website that uses this data. It should display the cafes, but it could also allow people to add new cafes or delete cafes.<br>
